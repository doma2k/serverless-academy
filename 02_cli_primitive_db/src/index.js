/* 
The Algorithm
After launching the program, a message is displayed asking for a name, meaning we enter the user creation mode:

Then you are prompted to choose a gender from the list;
Then specify age;
then the cycle with adding a user repeats. In this way you can add another user.
To stop adding users, just press ENTER instead of entering the name.

After refusing to add another user, the application prompts you to find the user by name in the database. You can choose between two answers: Y/N. If you choose N, exit, and if you choose Y, perform the search and inform you about the results: if the user is found in the database, display all the information about him/her, if not - indicate that such a user does not exist.

Important notes
You should use a regular text file (.txt) as your database. Add new users without overwriting previously added ones.
Organize data storage in your database so that each user can be easily turned into an object (JSON.parse and JSON.stringifyshould work just fine).
Pay attention to the search algorithm and take the variant that a user can write a request in caps lock, but still have to get a valid result
